   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>
     <b><i>Kalbi</i></b> is a classic Korean Barbeque Short Ribs dish, perfect for summer grilling, but perfectly suitable to make any time of year.<br>
   It’s marinated in a sweet and salty soy sauce-based marinade that caramelizes beautifully as the short ribs cook.

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk to combine the grated Asian pear, grated kiwi, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, and a few cracks of black pepper.<br>
       Combine in a marinade bag with the beef, and let marinate for at least 4 hours, and as long as overnight.</li>
       <li>Remove the beef from the marinade, and discard the marinade. Either grill the beef for 3-4 minutes on each side, or broil them on top of a wire rack set over a sheet pan, also for 3-4 minutes on each side.<br>
          If those two cooking options aren't available, you can also pan fry them in a skillet.
         <b>Cook them until they are caramelized and deeply brown on the edges.</b> Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>

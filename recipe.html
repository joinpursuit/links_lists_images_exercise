          <li> When you are content with the taste, add the eggs. </li>
          <li> <b> Stir well until combined.</b></li>

          <li> Add macaroni to the baking dish. </li>
          <li> Pour cheese mixture over macaroni. </li>
          <li> Make sure the cheese distributed well. </li>
          <li> Top with smoked cheddar cheese. </li>
          <li> Bake for 35-45 minutes.<b>Do not overbake.</b><i> It may be a bit jiggly when you take it out of the oven. It will firm up as it cool.</i> </li>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Can you cook a fancy meal? Of course you can! But who are you trying to impress? Not a soul.
And that's why nothing beats the classic bowl of cereal.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your favorite cereal</li>
  <li>Cold Milk (or non-dairy substitute)</li>
  <li>Bowl</li>
  <li>Spoon</li>

</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure your bowl and spoon are clean, as you'll be eating with them.</li>
  <li>Once clean, pour your preferred amount of cereal into your bowl.</li>
  <li>Add desired amount of milk to your bowl of cereal.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Note to cooks</h3>
  <p>
There's some debate as to the listed order of Steps 3. & 4., and really there shouldn't be.
<br>
Only godless savages add their milk (or non-dairy substitute) first.

    <p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled</li>
      <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>METHOD</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.</li>
      <li>n a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</li>
      <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350°F (175°C), or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
      <li> Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)
      </li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cake uses the technique of the Russian Napoleon cake (many thin puff pastry layers + moderate amount of pastry cream in between),
       but I recommend not waiting for 24 to 48 hours until the layers are completely softened.</p>


    <p>This will give you the absolute pleasure of experiencing different textures in each bite
       – crispy, flaky puff pastry and the super creamy pastry cream. You can wait until the cake
       becomes soft and tender, but you don’t have to. Try this recipe and decide for yourself
       which one you prefer.</p>

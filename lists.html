                <ol>
                <li>  Preheat your oven to 350 F degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>

<li>Place all the ingredients in the bowl of your mixer and using the paddle attachment mix everything until combined. (A whisk attachment can also be used). The cookie dough should be soft and easy to scoop.</li>

<li>You can use a small ice cream scoop to scoop out cookie balls or use your hands to roll out the dough into balls the size of a golf ball. Place them onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart, or 3 per row.</li>

<li>Using the back of a fork, press down onto each cookie ball, then press again from the opposite direction (90 degrees the other way).</li>

<li>Place both baking sheets in the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges of the cookies start to turn golden. DO NOT over-bake. They will still be soft when you take them out of the oven, but as they cool they will harden.</li>

<li>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets completely before transferring them.</li>

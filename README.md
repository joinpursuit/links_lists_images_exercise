### Exercise

Create an HTML document image.html and embed the following image in an HTML document:

![dinosaur](assets/image.jpg)

Also, do the following:

* Add some `alt` text, and check that it works by misspelling the image URL.
* Set the image's correct `width` and `height` (hint; it is 200px wide and 171px high), then experiment with other values to see what the effect is.
* Set a `title` on the image.
